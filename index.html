      <td>1. A key part to generative design and code is pattern and routine. Akin to a chess player, marking each move down, and keeping a trace of your decisions can prove useful for your own process and future making. As a designer, to know that there might be a variety of possibilities to a given situation, can aid our ways of observing by using tools in novel ways. In one series of work, Van Rossum looks to fundamentals of waveforms as a departure point and reference point for connecting an interface to affecting the parameters of a letterform. If the letters explode, so too would the speakers. Find 1 unique example of a pattern in nature, that appears to be programmatic. Post a visual of this pattern and describe how it is programmatic in nature.

    <h2> I. Tool Standards and Poetics </h2>
    <h3>My Response</h3>
<p>
        1. Both articles are clearly and assertively claiming the complaints on the same page. The first reading talks about predominating tools that set up standards and replace graphic design itself into their brands thus ruling not only the program but also designers' identity. The author points out that advanced functions do not directly mean usability, since those tools are not open-source software. The 'personal relationship with tools we use' would bring back the power of design and autonomy through cooperating with open source.
In reading 2, the author reads the 'privatization' that taking the platform of sharing ideas freely under the control of a big company called Microsoft. Although, it is a special case in property of the coding field compared to other design areas that copyrights matter; revealing every work the designers did and others taking them to build their own. Yet, designers always make and improve their works by sharing and being inspired by others. According to the article, Github does not only provide open-source codes, but manages large projects and works as a social network. The author considers the purchase of Github by a corporation as blocking keeping 'ecosystem of independent businesses'. Both articles insist on the importance of the liberated mediums to release artists to develop each field. 
<br><br>
2. In my view for the overall impact that graphic design spreads, I believe that understanding whether our design is politically correct is an essential skill. This ethical and sensitive matter does not only deliver messages to the outside; it examines how design can be related to social problems deeper, therefore, suggesting further improvement of design more than the aesthetic aspect which is easily misunderstood by general people. Harmless design frees designers to the next step.

    Hi, Samantha! First, I have to say that it is impressive how you summarized two articles and add some of your opinions to make your writing powerful and to help understanding the flow. I can read the static theme you have found through reading the given articles. And I am 100% agree with the significant skill you think; controlling Adobe functions to make work does matter too, but the handwork is basic and truly designers' own technique. The firm understanding of design elements without the help of digital software (yes, it is helpful though...) would train our quality as designers and let us explore more freely.

    <h3>My Response</h3>
<p>
    1. The definition of the universal user by Lialina is interesting; they are describing it like survivors in a lawless zone or a technician working a patchwork with scrap metals, that maximizes freedom and disorder of use of a computer when universal usability means to be a modest and kind approach of the web. But it seems that it opposes the argument of Schwulst's, because Lialina is rather claiming the self-release as a universal user based on the limitless platform. As Lialina has said, using Twitter to visit the homepage (and gain information&inspiration) is not intended as proper usage, but is supported by Twitter as well somehow.
<br><br>
    2. I would like to say myself as an internet user a second-hand market. As I mentioned the patchwork, I enjoy producing something itself or based on a certain platform and displaying them in unintended and insincere arrange. They are rather an archive, but still keeping values to be refound or reuse. Also, I like to watch people finding ways to do their 'mess' art, intentionally denying platform rules but presenting artistic identity as a new media artist. The pleasure of discovery of challenge to the limit is from the ability of people; "There can be different examples and levels of autonomy that users can imagine for themselves, but the capacity to be universal is still in all of us." (Lialina, 2012).

    Hi Danielle, I can relate to your overall opinion as a normal thus understandable internet user. It is true that most people use computers as a simple tool for convenience and speed, and I liked that you said they might don't want to be, which shares the same way of thinking of 'users are busy, not stupid' in the original text. And you referred that platforms suggest connection using algorithm. I believe it is the most strong aspect of the platform for beginners of everything on the internet. (I thought the same thing but omitted it because I worried about being out of point for my own one!)
I like your metaphor of running water, it is very accurate. Many criticize that makes people lazy nowadays, but yes, it is fun to see what's going on the stream. Maybe that's why I love Twitter.

    For the Prompt 1, I was immediately reminded of one specific programmed pattern in nature. It is a honeycomb. Honeycomb consists of lots of cells. The cells are not placed straight in facing columns even though they are well aligned in rows; it shows they are intended to be misaligned with a certain distance (half of the cell to be exact). I see it as programmed order to fill the empty gap among the cells and increase the durability of the honeycomb. Moreover, to give a closer look, it shows that each cell is a hexagon. Hexagon looks complicated in the view of humans, but nature prefers the form and it is well known to be the shape of a honeycomb. Why does it have to be hexagon? The reason is that hexagon is the most sturdy shape that can support the weight of honey plus the power of gravity when holding as much honey as possible. One scientific fact that many would not be aware of is that the initial shape bees make is actually a circle, and then the cells change into hexagons. I don't know do bees intended it, but I found sharing the idea of "keeping a trace of your decisions" of the Prompt 1 to make the ultimate shape for better design.

    Hi, Samantha! It is impressive that you talked about the flow of water and presented some examples before mentioning the specific name of water cymatics. It opened possibilities of controlling the flow of water in a more natural way when I have quite a solid image for water cymatics (which is a scientific experiment)... You gave nice examples. That is to say, do you think any random move that is not intended to make a flow and the result can be a design? I believe that nature somehow has programmed and has routine, then what about intentionally unintended artificial control to give waves to water? For water cymatics, should it be a song with constant rhythm?

<h3> Response for Tia </h3>
<p>
    Hi, Tia! I liked the idea of seeing pruning as a controlling factor of design. As you said the fractals the branches make are a design since there is a pattern (thicker to thinner as they grow higher and further), and you suggested another source of error which is artificial. It is interesting that it is complicated programming for the collaboration of nature and humans. Have you heard about crown shyness? I came up with the concept when I read your response. It is a phenomenon that some adjacent trees grow their leaves and branches making a constant gap among other's. Just like the fractals you mentioned, I think those make programmed patterns with branches.

    <h2>IV. In Free Fall</h2>
    <h3>My Response</h3>
<p>
    I would like to define surveillance as a process to record and analyze everything on the ground, othering those, from the privileged and separated status. As floating surveillance, it collapses the concept of the immobile and ultimate spectator from the linear perspective, yet since the society individualizes, the new surveillance rather inspects everything. In words of safety and convenience, technology goes invading vertical spaces while surveillance follows in order. Vertical view is not only our life but also entertainment now as Steyerl said. The broad and accessible exposed vertical view hands authority to everyone to observe all which are not necessary to do so, thus spreading the indifference of observing including unnecessary things. We gain too much, using personal drones and free services such as Google Maps. We all do surveillance, while not aware of it. For the disordered usage of 3D, when the author mentioned cinema, reminds me of recent computer games which allow fly mode or even support it. It normalizes the god's-eye view as Steyerl insisted, and routinize the sense of surveillance; "We are growing increasingly accustomed to what used to be called a God’s-eye view." (Steryerl).

<h3>Response for Mary</h3>
<p>
    Hi, Mary! I agree that the Aerial perspective is more invasive, since it is on the opposite of the ground we stick our foot on. Also as we do not aware of surveillance, and the fact that we are examined from different angles just as objectification, I understand why Steyerl said it is pornographic. Pornography, in whatever meaning, is entertainment now and I liked your thought that the viewer looking down on them and feels superior. You can read my post because I found the common idea between us of making surveillance entertainment. When this sense goes more common, society will destroy and it is our demise for sure, and I believe that is the true purpose or meaning of surveillance.
</p>
<h3>Response for Tu</h3>
<p>
    I liked that you allowed me to explore the sense of the aerial perspectives with actual visual examples through the ages, from the classic (it sounds a bit weird though) measured view to the unbalanced and giddy modern view. Still, They share distorted and unstable feelings. I wonder how are you going to describe that the allusion triggered from the view impacts a close observation you mentioned? Because I think the distorted image somehow contorts the object (I meant people), rather than reflecting it. The usage of the imaginary stable ground, how would this impact the concept of surveillance?
